## Description
### Introduction

In the ever-changing world of interior design and home decor, "The Crafted Nest" is a leader in innovation and creativity. To improve customer experience and engagement, I started an exciting project to create an Augmented Reality (AR)-based product catalog. This modern solution combines the physical and digital worlds, allowing customers to explore and see our beautiful furniture and decor items directly over the catalog.

### Technologies Used

To make this vision a reality, I used Unity and Vuforia, two powerful tools in the AR and game development field. Unity, known for its flexibility and strong capabilities, was the foundation for developing our interactive catalog. Vuforia, a top AR platform, was seamlessly integrated to add augmented reality features, letting users interact with our products in real-time.

### Features and Usages

Customers can see and interact with 3D models of our furniture pieces directly over the physical catalog. This feature gives a detailed and realistic view of our products, helping customers understand the design, size, and look without needing to imagine them in their actual space. Users can hover their mobile devices over specific catalog pages to bring the products to life in 3D. This feature turns the traditional catalog browsing experience into an engaging and interactive journey.
